There are also many cases of abuses of apps that require you to move with your smart device. When a reward is at play, the risk is even higher. People try to trick apps by installing them on simulators and by programming the movement. That way, without even moving from their living room, they can show that they are walking somewhere. This is not ideal when there is a reward involved or where the accurate position of a person is very crucial — like in the police example.

Moreover, all user-provided data must be validated, even if it doesn’t come from an input box. There are many things a programmer has to look for: is the data in the right format, is it safe to be stored in the database, is it not going to be harmful to the server or other users, is it safe to be displayed etc. Even though every programmer should think about all of these issues, there is one in particular that many may miss. Validating data against the domain of the service. Validating data based on probability, that what has been provided is not fake, user-inputted data, but rather verified it is genuine, probable data that came from an honest individual. This work is focused on the latter use-case and is aiming to provide an algorithm to mark any data as fake if it is not possible to be truthful.
